## Famly app 

An app displaying children in a table and actions performd on their records are CheckIn and Check out which calls the api below;
A table was chosen to render the list because
- The list is already ordered in alphabetical order
- Navigation can be fast and a search feature implemented for fast searches.
- it allows the data to be viewed in a structured manner.
- a length of 5 children per page

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.



# Interested in working for Famly?

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! ü§© 

How to get started:
- Fork this repository
- Create a small application in React (or another agreed upon framework)
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should be able to do 3 things:
1. List children with some form of pagination/lazy-loading/infinite-scroll
2. Checkin a child
3. Checkout a child

There are no other requirements than that‚Äîdon't worry about design or anything like that.
